            "Our game is an endless tower defense that requires the user to defend their space station from the  progressively difficult waves of oncoming enemy ships.  While defending your space station you have the option to upgrade it, giving you more attack speed, cannon rotation speed, ally ships, and a shield refresh.  Your goal is to survive as long as you can while also taking down as many enemy ships possible before you become over run.",
            "Cosmic Conflict first began as a project from a game jam that the GAMED club held.  From there, the group's members have been focusing their efforts on polishing the game such that it can meet their high standards!"

A simple game is provided at the end, enabling you to fly Mr. Goose through the air, avoiding clouds.",
            "Mr. Goose was released back in 2012 on iOS as a way for Steve McNeilly, the CEO of Aviation Tutorials & David McNeilly’s father, to experiment with developing products on the mobile market.  The game featured the story of Mr. Goose, which was written and illustrated by Rachel McNeilly (David’s younger sister who was 7 at the time), and as an added bonus, a mini game was thrown in as well!  The app is currently unplayable on iOS, as Steve has no intentions of updating it for modern hardware."

But watch out for the deadly traps that line the walls of the tunnels. Each tunnel is procedurally generated, and is unique to that runner, so every run is different, and every runner gets a new tunnel each game. If you complete your tunnel, you will earn cash to purchase upgrades, or Hacks from the Dark Web, which can hack the tunnel building algorithm, making the tunnels of your opponents much more difficult. Your tunnels will also all increase in difficulty, so each tunnel you run will get more and more deadly, until you fail.",

There are five different dinosaurs that you can change into, and each has its own unique skills. Some dinosaurs are only available in certain areas of the map. To change to a different dinosaur, you must first change back to the original raptor. If you are not sure what to do next, the pause screen has lots of useful information. It shows you what dinosaur you currently are, the actions you can perform, the other dinosaurs you can currently change into,  and your overall progress in the game so far. The goal of Papersaurs is to collect five teeth, one for each dinosaur."

        paragraphs: [
            "Up to 4 players compete to repair their castle first. Before each round, players choose cards to play, which alter the gameplay. Be the last one standing to earn points, and use those points to either upgrade your character, or repair your castle. Upgrading your character allows you to select more cards, and increases both your move speed and attack speed. Each round, you draw a new card, and can select up to as many cards as your player level. The strategy is to not be distracted by pumping all your points into repairing the castle. While that is your main objective, you will quickly begin to fail every round if you don't spend some points to upgrade your base stats. However, if you always select the maximum number of cards, you will quickly run out of options."
